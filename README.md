##Data Information and Knoweledge
### Relational Data
#### Diference between data information and knowledge
Data are the raw bits of information with no contextthat can be quantitative or qualitative. Information is data that has been given context and can be useful. Knowledge is data that is put in contwxt , aggregated and analysed to be used by organisations to make decisions
##### Data of a small company
The primary key in the cumstomer and order tables will be the order number because its the common unique factor amongst both tables.
The customer table will be related to the order table using the order number hence an product will be sent to someone with ths same order number in the customer table and the order table.
The foreign key is the order table will be the cuctomer name which is imported from the customer table.
##### Reason for data types
Data types helps inform the database what functions can be performed with the data.
Data types helps to allocate the proper amount of storage space
### Big Data
##### Volume
It represents the amount of data and refers to the mass quantity of data that organisations have been trying to harness and improve decission making .
##### Velocity
This represents the motion of data. due to the recent real-time nature of data,companies have invested alot in big data which could incorporate streaming data into business processes and decision making.
##### variety 
It defines the different types of data types and data resources.such as structured data like back statements and unstructured data like twitter feeds that are not well defined.
##### Veracity
This is the trustworthiness of data ie calculations of the noises ,biases and abnormalities of data. Veracity is the level of reliability of certain type of data.
#### Types of technology that increased need for big data.
##### Suitable storage for big data 
Hadoop distribution file system is one of the most prefered file system to store  big data
##### Data ingestion
This refers to taking data from the source to alocation where it can be processed by using methods such as;
Batchload from RDBMS using sqoop,data loading from files, real-time data loading.
##### Data cleaning and processing(Exploratoru data analysis)
This is the use of a sample to represent a large database that would file up the memory space example Mapredusejap, Pig, hivescript.
##### Visualisation of data
This is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical form.tools suchas tableau and qlikview are used.
##### Application for machine learning Algorithims
This explores the study and construction of algorithims that can learn from and make predition of data.
## Structured Query language SQL
##### RDBMS (relational database management systems)
this databse is where dat is organised in one or more tables.
##### SQL (Structured uery language) 
This is a programming language that can be used to work with arelational database.
RDBMS and SQL are related that SQl is able to manipulate and access data easily that has been organised in tables by RDBMS.
The purpose of SQL is to help databases manipulate and access relational data.
##### Primary Key
This is the unique identifier of a given record of data.(customer id)
##### Foreign key
This is a group of columns in the database that provides a link to the between two tables.
The relationship between the customer id and the order id means that for each unique customer id the is an orderid assigned to the customer thus a customer can have different order ids but with the same customer id.
#### SQL injections
This is the code technique that can be used to destroy the database.
Its is the placement of malicious codes in the SQl statementsvia the webpage input.
Although by use of SQL parameters a wesite can be protected from SQL injections.

## Code of Ethics
#### Ethical and legal implications
The purpose of code of ethics is to outline an acceptable behaviour for professional or social group. it details actions that are considered appropriate and inappropriate.
##### ACM code of computing discipline
This was formulated as statements of personal responsibility, identifies the elements of such a commitment.
##### Acceptable Use Policies(AUP)
This are used by many organisations that provide technology services to a group of constituieises or public. The public requires an agreement to the AUP before those services can be accessed
##### while
Code of ethics is the overroll outline of a set of acceptable behaviour for a professional or social group on the web.
#### USA Copyrights Office Fair Use Index.
This is the project undertaken by the Us register in support of the 2013 joint strategic plan on intellectual property enforcement of the office of the intellectual property enforcement cordinator.(iPEC)
The fair use index tracts a variety of judicial decissions to help boyh the laywers and the public to better understand the types of uses the courts have previously considered to be fair of unfair.

### Intellectual Property 
##### Purpose and importance of WIPO
The purpose of WIPO is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international system that enables innoation and creativity for the benefit of all parties involved.
The importance of WIPO is to help the governments , businesses and society to realise the benefits of intellectual property and its need to be protected.
#### how to obtain copyright.
In the majority of countries, and according to the Berne Convention, copyright protection is obtained automatically without the need for registration or other formalities.
Most countries nonetheless have a system in place to allow for the voluntary registration of works. Such voluntary registration systems can help solve disputes over ownership or creation, as well as facilitate financial transactions, sales, and the assignment and/or transfer of rights.
Please note that WIPO does not offer a copyright registration system or a searchable copyright database. Find out more about copyright registration and documentation systems.
Copyrights are important to protect creative and orginal ideas of innovation from being duplicated
When are copyright is filed to the US copyrights office , the service /product cannot be duplicated by anyone in the USA without he consent of the owner.
##### Copyright of a Svg Image
This protects the imahe from being used by others without paying you or asking your permission before they use it.
The trademark of the svg image allows the owner  to communicate the source or orgin of the product /service to the customers which helps on the attonery to identify protect and enforce ip rights in the USA.
## Information Collection
### COPPA FERPA HIPPA
#### COPPA Chirldren Online Privacy Protection Act
This act was enforced by thr federal trade commision  where by organisation must make a goal of faith effort to determine the age of those accessing their websites. If the users are under they must obtain parental consent before collecting any information.
#### FERPA Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
This protects the privacy of students records in the USA. Children under the age of 18yrs still in high school their information fron educational institutions can only be accessed with parental acceptance.
#### HIPPA Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
This is the law that specifically singles out records related to health care as a special class of personally identifiable information. This law gives rights to patients to access their medical records from health institutions.
